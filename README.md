guzzle-toggl
============

A Toggl API client based on Guzzle PHP

## Features

* supports partial version 9 API with API Key authentication (thanks to @edward-simpson)
* supports Toggl Report Api v2 (thanks to @dirx)
* now based on guzzle 7 

See v1.2.0 for the last version based on guzzle6. At the moment both versions are the same except for the supported guzzle version. 
New releases will be based on guzzle7. 

## Installation

The library is available through Composer, so it's easy to get it. 
Simply run this to install it:

    composer require ajt/guzzle-toggl

## Usage
    
To use the Toggl API Client simply instantiate the client with the api key.
More information on the key and authentication available at https://github.com/toggl/toggl_api_docs/blob/master/chapters/authentication.md

```php
<?php

require __DIR__.'/../vendor/autoload.php';

use AJT\Toggl\TogglClient;
$toggl_token = ''; // Fill in your token here
$toggl_client = TogglClient::factory(['api_key' => $toggl_token]);

// if you want to see what is happening, add debug => true to the factory call
$toggl_client = TogglClient::factory(['api_key' => $toggl_token, 'debug' => true]); 
```

Invoke Commands using our `__call` method (auto-complete phpDocs are included)

```php
<?php 
use AJT\Toggl\TogglClient;
$toggl_client = TogglClient::factory(['api_key' => $toggl_token]);

$workspaces = $toggl_client->getWorkspaces([]);

foreach($workspaces as $workspace){
	$id = $workspace['id'];
	print $workspace['name'] . "\n";
}
``` 

Or Use the `getCommand` method (in this case you need to work with the $response['data'] array:

```php
<?php 
use AJT\Toggl\TogglClient;
$toggl_client = TogglClient::factory(['api_key' => $toggl_token]);

//Retrieve the Command from Guzzle
$command = $toggl_client->getCommand('GetWorkspaces', []);
$command->prepare();

$response = $command->execute();

$workspaces = $response['data'];

foreach($workspaces as $workspace){
	$id = $workspace['id'];
	print $workspace['name'] . "\n";
}
```

## Examples
Copy the apikey-dist.php to apikey.php (in the root directory) and add your apikey.
Afterwards you can execute the examples in the examples directory. 

You can look at the services.json for details on what methods are available and what parameters are available to call them

## Migrating to v9
Almost all the methods retain the same naming, but some parameters have changed.

The following endpoints now require a `workspace_id` to be passed in the parameters:
- CreateClient
- GetClient
- UpdateClient
- DeleteClient
- CreateProject
- GetProject
- UpdateProject
- CreateProjectUser
- CreateProjectUsers
- UpdateProjectUser
- UpdateProjectUsers
- DeleteProjectUser
- DeleteProjectUsers
- CreateTag
- UpdateTag
- DeleteTag
- CreateTask (also requires a `project_id`)
- GetTask (also requires a `project_id`)
- UpdateTask (also requires a `project_id`)
- UpdateTasks (also requires a `project_id`)
- DeleteTask (also requires a `project_id`)
- DeleteTasks (also requires a `project_id`)
- StartTimeEntry
- StopTimeEntry
- UpdateTimeEntry
- DeleteTimeEntry

The following endpoints now require a `project_id` to be passed in the parameters:
- CreateTask
- GetTask
- UpdateTask
- UpdateTasks
- DeleteTask
- DeleteTasks

The following endpoints are new:
- ArchiveClient
- RestoreClient

The following endpoints have changed their parameters:
- GetProjects (`id` is now `workspace_id`, for clarity)
- GetProjectUsers no longer accepts a `project_id` parameter, but instead accepts a `workspace_id` parameter

The following endpoints have had their name changed, to match the toggl docs more closely:
- InviteWorkspaceUser -> InviteOrganizationUser

The following endpoints have been removed:
- GetWorkspaceWorkspaceUsers
- GetWorkspaceProjects (use GetProjects instead)
